# Export the best/most recent available JPEG preview image to the same folder as the 
# raw files.

# Order of preference for embedded images, in case more than one exists
# 1/ JpgFromRaw (assumed to be a processed version of the RAW, so most recent)
# 2/ PreviewImage (assumed to be the camera preview image)

# This config attempts to extract each image in turn. exiftool will not overrwrite an
# image file, so once an image is extracted subsequent extractions will do nothing.

# 1/ JpgFromRaw
-w
# Put all files in the same folder as the source image. Existing images will not be 
# overwritten but new metadata will be (re)written in to them later.

# Binary extraction (instead of just listing the binary tag attributes)  
-b
# Assume that JpgFromRaw is higher resolution or more recent than Preview Image
-preview:JpgFromRaw

# Run execute to copy the preview to a file now
-execute

# 2/ PreviewImage 
-if
not $JpgFromRaw
-w
# Put all files in the same folder as the source image. Existing images will not be 
# overwritten but new metadata will be (re)written in to them later.

# Extracted previews don't contain metadata, so copy metadata from the source raw file.

# Run execute to extract the files ...
-execute

# ... and then copy metadata from the source file to the exported previews

# Note: EXIF data will be written in to the jpg image even if the image was
# not created by this action, eg, it existed before this action was run. So,
# don't overwrite any existing tag values.
