# Export the best/most recent available JPEG preview image to a sub-folder called

# Order of preference for preview images, in case more than one exists:
# 1/ An ACDSee cached preview image from the [Developed] sub-folder
# 2/ The best available embedded preview image from the selcted file using the 
# custom tag "BigImage" which is defined in the exiftool config file .Exiftool_config.
# BigImage brings back the largest of JpegFromRaw or PreviewImage if they exist 
# in the selected file.

# This args file attempts to extract each image in turn. Exiftool will not overrwrite
# an image file, so once an image is extracted subsequent extractions will do nothing.

# 1/ Try and copy ACDSee previews from the preview cache folder named [Developed]
# Todo: check if source file exists to avoid warnings

# No need to check if target file exists: exiftool will never overwrite an image

-srcfile
[Developed]/%f.%e.jpg

# -o will cause copy instead of move behaviour, as long as -overwrite_original is 
# not set
-o
%dInstantExport/%f_%e.jpg

-execute

# 2/ Try and extract BigImage (a composite tag as defined in .Exiftool_config) 
# Check if target already exists to avoid a warning?
# No need to check if target file exists: exiftool will never overwrite an image

-w
%dInstantExport/%f_%e.jpg

# Use binary mode to extract image data

# Extracted previews don't contain metadata, so next copy in tag values from the 
# source file.

# Run execute to extract the files ...
-execute

# ... and then copy metadata from the source file to the exported previews

# Todo: Check that the file exists to avoid error output if no preview could be extracted

# If the jpg was not actually written by this action (maybe it was created 
# some time before) it might have it's own up to date metadata. So, don't 
# overwrite any existing tag values.
