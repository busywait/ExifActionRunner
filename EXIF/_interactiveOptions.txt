# Options for exiftool to show progress and pause at the end of processing 
# to allow review of output

#Keep the console open after finishing
-k
# -k waits for Carriage Return press.
# (It's easier to let exiftool do this than put pause or set /p in calling batch files)

#Show progress messages in the console after each file
-progress
#Show progress in the window title
-progress:
#Don't keep backup files
#-overwrite_original
#Uncomment the line above if you are very confident of exiftool re-writing your source files

#Ignore minor errors - downgrade error to a warning - could lose some
#maker notes according to the docs. I needed this for an Olympus 
#out-of-the-camera jpegs.
