# An example Exif Action to write values for any of F number, focal length, and Subject Distance.

# Save this file with a name like "Lens fX.txt"
# and edit the values after the = signs. 

# To avoid writing any tag either comment it out with a #
# as the first character of the line or delete the line.

# Lines starting with # are comments and can be deleted,
# a descriptive first line comment is helpful.

# Quotes are not stripped from these values. Avoid spaces at the end of lines.

# For a zoom lens the following values vary so add them as seperate 
# actions. Focal Length is important for lens distortion correction.

#0x920a Exif.Image.FocalLength
#-FocalLength=200 mm

#0x829d Exif.Image.FNumber
#-FNumber=5.6

# 0x9206 Exif.Image.SubjectDistance
# The distance to the subject in metres
#-SubjectDistance=10 m
