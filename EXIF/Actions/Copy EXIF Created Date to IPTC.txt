# Copy the Created Date from the EXIF data to the IPTC data.
# Note that the EXIF Create Date includes a time, the IPTC date does not when written by exiftool.
-Iptc:DateCreated<$Exif:CreateDate

# To go the other way use
# exiftool "-Exif:CreateDate<$Iptc:DateCreated 00:00:00"
# forcing the missing timestamp to be 00:00:00
