# Export all embedded preview images to a sub-folder called previews. Typically 
# these will have no metadata associated, see the "Copy Tags from Raw.txt" 
# action to add metadata from the original raw, or use the Export Best Jpeg.bat 
# wrapped action to extract the best preview and add metadata the same time. 

# Write a file for each preview that is extracted (upper-case W) to avoid 
# multiple jpegs in the same file:
-W
# put all files in to a sub-folder called "previews"
%dpreviews/%f_%e_%t%-c.%s

# Binary extraction, don't just list the tag attributes  
-b
# Export *all* preview images, including tiny thumbnails and non-jpeg formats:
-preview:All
