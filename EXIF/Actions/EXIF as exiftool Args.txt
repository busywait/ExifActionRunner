# Export EXIF tag names and values in a format suitable for re-importing
# Be careful because exiftool 10.6.0 strips trailing spaces from values 
# in this output format - use the -j (json format) option to see spaces.

# Write output to a file in the same folder as the image
-w
%d%f-%e-exif-args.txt

# Format the output as an exiftool input arg file 
-argFormat

#List all values including duplicates
-a

#List values for unknown tags
-U

#Prefix all tags with the Family 1 Group Name (these groups are "specific location")
-G1

# List the tag name (as used for writing) instead of the tag description.
# Usually very similar, eg, LensModel instead of Lens Model
-s
