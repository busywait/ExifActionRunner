# This action removes the default text added by my camera to the EXIF:Description.

# Olympus cameras (for example E-PL7) write a default description in the 
# EXIF:Description tag: "OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA". That is useless to me and 
# I cannot change it in the camera. If these images are uploaded or edited 
# then these default descriptions get copied in to other fields and displayed, 
# which I do not want. The same information is stored in other EXIF fields 
# which I can read if needed.

# Uncomment this line to show helpful information when this command is run
#-v2

#Ignore leading and trailing whitespace during comparisons by including 
#this command line option
#-api
#Filter=s/^\s+|\s+($)//g
#...doesn't work, or only works for comparisons using if?
#-if 
#$ImageDescription eq 'OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA         '

# There are 9 spaces at the end of this value that my camera writes:
-ImageDescription-=OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA         
# Some software might have stripped the trailing spaces, so also look for a fixed
# version with no trailing spaces:
-ImageDescription-=OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA

# Uncomment this line and edit it as needed. Exiftool will write this string 
# only if one of the previous removals was actioned:
#-ImageDescription=Picture from my digital camera

# If an image has been edited then the Description will likely have been  
# copied to the XMP dc:Description element, so check that too.
# ACDSee software will copy the trailing spaces to Description (raw develop)
-Description-=OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA         
# Adobe software strips the trailing space
-Description-=OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA

# Uncomment this line and edit it as needed. Exiftool will write this string 
# only if one of the previous removals was actioned:    
#-Description=Picture from my digital camera

# Adobe software also copies Image Description to the IPTC Caption Abstract
-Caption-Abstract-=OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA
 
# Uncomment this line and edit it as needed. Exiftool will write this string 
# only if the previous removal was actioned:    
#-Caption-Abstract=Picture from my digital camera

#ACDSee 10 displays the XMP Description as Image Description in the "All EXIF" panel 
#(and also shows the XMP Lens value in as the EXIF Lens Model) - use Exiftool
#to see the actual EXIF values.
