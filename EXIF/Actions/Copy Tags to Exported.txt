# Copy metadata from selected files to previously exported preview image files. 
# Select the original raw files and run this action to copy across the tag 
# values to images created using the "Export Embedded Images.txt" action.

# Warning:

# 0/ This will not overwrite any existing tag values (-writeMode cg is used). 
# This action is intended for adding metadata to extracted previews.

# 1/ Any new tags will be copied from any raw files in to any existing .xmp sidecar 
# files if you are running this with automatic processing of sidecars. Sidecar
# processing is the default unless a custom calling script has set 
# "sidecar_mode=ignore". (Tags values will not be overwritten though).

# 2/ If an image was extracted from a .xmp file then no metadata will be copied 
# in to it if you are relying on automatic processing of raw file sidecars. 
# Select the .xmp file directly.

# 3/ If more than one version exists then only the first from the list of 
# srcfile options below will have metadata copied in to it.
