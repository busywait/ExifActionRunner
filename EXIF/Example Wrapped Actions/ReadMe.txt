These scripts show how to wrap an action in a runnable .bat file. The wrapped actions must
be in the same folder as "Exif Action Runner.bat" to work. 

Notice that all of the .bat scripts are the same apart from their name and the action
file name that they reference. The .bat file does not have to have the same name as the 
action, but it might help you to remember which action is being called.

You can configure your image manager or Windows "Send To" to call a wrapped action.
